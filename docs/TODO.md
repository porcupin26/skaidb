# skaidb — to do

**The single consolidated list of all pending work**, roughly in priority
order within each area. Shipped feature state lives in
[SEARCH.md](SEARCH.md) / [TIMESERIES.md](TIMESERIES.md) /
[VECTOR.md](VECTOR.md) / [UI.md](UI.md) / [GRAFANA.md](GRAFANA.md) / the
README; measured results, performance dead ends, and benchmark
methodology in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md); everything completed, in
git history.

## Full-text search

- [ ] **[fts] Sharded scatter for aggregations and fast-field sort** —
  the one open FTS feature. Per-shard partials / per-shard sorted top-k
  need per-key ownership filters (a ring-hash fast field kept consistent
  through resharding epochs) so RF < members doesn't double-count
  replicas, plus new internode request variants carrying the ownership
  ranges. Correctness-critical: wants its own design + fleet-bench cycle
  (kill/rejoin and mid-reshard races), not a drive-by. Today sharded
  corpora take the correct-but-slower coordinator fallback; this also
  gates per-hit explain on sharded clusters.
- [ ] **[fts] Lift the grouped-metrics pushdown guard** when
  [quickwit-oss/tantivy#2992](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy/issues/2992)
  is fixed upstream (per-bucket metrics currently take the exact row
  fallback; doc-count-only groupings still push down).
- [ ] **[fts] Phase-9 residue**: the 24 h mixed ingest+query soak
  (deferred on request); disk-full-mid-merge injection (needs a
  fault-injecting filesystem — torn-dir injection shipped and found a
  real bug); re-run the ES A/B campaign to publish post-guard,
  post-`MATCH_CROSS`/`BOOSTED` numbers in BENCHMARKS.md.
- [ ] **[fts] top_hits SQL surface** — shipped on the ES subset
  (per-bucket top documents); a native SQL spelling (window functions or
  a dedicated per-group-top-k clause) is an open language-design
  question.
- [ ] **[fts] Global BM25 statistics mode** — per-shard stats today (like
  ES across shards); an optional global-stats mode if result-set parity
  tests ever care.
- [ ] **[fts] ES-REST extras on demand**: `minimum_should_match` > 1,
  multi_match per-field `^boosts` (declined today with a pointer to
  `<col>.boost`), `top_hits` explicit sort, `_mget`, index templates —
  add when a real client needs them.
- [ ] **[fts] Merge-policy tuning on LXC-class disks**: conditional —
  revisit only if an ingest-heavy workload surfaces merge stalls (the
  ingest win over ES leaves no urgency).

## Time-series

- [ ] **[ts] Streamed TS results** — TS SELECT materializes before the
  (streamable) wire; large raw range dumps should stream end-to-end like
  row-table `QueryStream`.
- [ ] **[ts] Label postings index** — regex matchers shipped
  (scan-based, fine at moderate cardinality); a postings index remains
  the perf unlock for high-cardinality matching.
- [ ] **[ts] PromQL partial gather** — investigated 2026-07-08 and
  **declined as inexact**: the raw evaluator's range window is
  `[t-w, t]` (both boundaries inclusive) while partials bucket
  `[b, b+step)`, so samples landing exactly on step boundaries — the
  common case for scraped data — would silently differ. Needs a
  windowed-partial variant (per-window `(t-w, t]` partials over the
  wire). Groundwork shipped: `Backend::ts_partials` exposes the cluster
  partial scatter to the server layer.
- [ ] **[ts] PromQL round 3** — subqueries, `group_left`/`group_right`
  many-to-one matching, `topk`/`bottomk`; then the node-exporter
  dashboard panel-by-panel diff against a real Prometheus (the original
  phase-7 exit criterion).
- [ ] **[ts] Rollup opportunistic serving, clustered** — single-node
  shipped; clustered needs a min-over-replicas head-boundary exchange
  (pairs naturally with the sharded-partials wire work).
- [ ] **[ts] Exemplars / native histograms** — chunk-format headroom is
  reserved.
- [ ] **[ts] Validation soak** — 24 h Prometheus remote_write
  side-by-side with its own TSDB, zero-loss comparison (the TS phase-4
  exit criterion; deferred with the other soaks).

## Performance

(The audit record — what already holds, measured dead ends, methodology —
lives in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md#performance-engineering-notes).)

- [ ] **[perf] Merkle-tree anti-entropy** — paged repair compares every
  key each pass; a Merkle tree per table would make repair cost
  proportional to divergence, not table size.
- [ ] **[perf] Vector index persistence** — HNSW graphs are in-memory
  and rebuilt from the table on open (slow for large sets). Persist
  per-segment graphs alongside the LSM (snapshot + mmap), quantized
  vectors in RAM.
- [ ] **[perf] Lazy index-order merge for unbounded `ORDER BY`** —
  `ORDER BY <indexed>` without `LIMIT` still materializes the index in
  order first; a lazy merge would stream it. (With `LIMIT` the top-k
  path already avoids the sort.)
- [ ] **[perf] Memtable flush without clones** — flush streams entries
  but still clones each key/value even though the memtable is dropped
  right after; a consuming iterator would halve the transient flush
  spike. Background path only.
- [ ] **[perf] Per-statement replica/peer snapshot** — `replicas_for`
  builds a fresh `Vec` per row in batch replication and peer addresses
  clone per fan-out site. Measured class: a few small allocations next
  to an fsync + RTT — cleaner CPU profile, no expected throughput
  change.
